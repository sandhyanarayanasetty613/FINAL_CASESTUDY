An immutable value is one whose content cannot be changed without creating an entirely new value.

In JavaScript, primitive values are immutable — once a primitive value is created, 
it cannot be changed, although the variable that holds it may be reassigned another value. 
By contrast, objects and arrays are mutable by
 default — their properties and elements can be changed without reassigning a new value.
